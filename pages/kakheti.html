      Kakheti (Georgian: კახეთი K’akheti; [kʼɑχɛtʰi]) is a region (mkhare)
      formed in the 1990s in eastern Georgia from the historical province of
      Kakheti and the small, mountainous province of Tusheti. Telavi is its
      capital. The region comprises eight administrative districts: Telavi,
      Gurjaani, Qvareli, Sagarejo, Dedoplistsqaro, Signagi, Lagodekhi and
      Akhmeta. Kakheti is bordered by the Russian Federation with the adjacent
      subdivisions (Chechnya to the north, and Dagestan to the northeast), the
      country of Azerbaijan to the southeast, and with the regions of
      Mtskheta-Mtianeti and Kvemo Kartli to the west. Kakheti has a strong
      linguistic and cultural identity, since its ethnographic subgroup of
      Kakhetians speak the Kakhetian dialect of Georgian.

      The Kakheti Wine Region is located in the eastern part of Georgia and
      comprises two river basins, Iori and Alazani. These rivers have a
      significant influence on the character of Kakhetian wines. Kakheti is
      bordered on the west by another very important wine region of Georgia -
      Kartli. Together with the location, the climatic conditions of the region
      play an essential role in the formation of Kakheti wines. Kakheti
      vineyards are cultivated at an altitude of 250-800 meters above sea level.
      We can find both humid subtropicals as well as continental climates in the
      region. Kakheti terroir provides ideal conditions for both local varieties
      and international wine varieties as well. When talking about the Kakheti
      wine region, the first thing that comes to mind is Rkatsiteli and Saperavi
      grapes. These two wine varieties have become the face of the region and
      Georgia. With the increase in the awareness of Georgian wine, the interest
      in these varieties is growing, so do not be surprised if you encounter
      these Kakhetian wine varieties in different wine regions in the world.
