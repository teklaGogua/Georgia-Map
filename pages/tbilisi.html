  <h2>Tbilisi</h2>
  <p>
    The name Tbilisi derives from Old Georgian t′bilisi (Asomtavruli: ႧႡႨႪႨႱႨ,
    Mkhedruli: თბილისი), and further from tpili (Modern Georgian: თბილი, 'warm',
    itself from Old Georgian: ႲႴႨႪႨ ṭpili). The name T′bili or T′bilisi
    (literally, 'warm location') was therefore given to the city because of the
    area's numerous sulfuric hot springs.

    Tbilisi (English: /təbɪˈliːsi, təˈbɪlɪsi/ tə-bil-EE-see, tə-BIL-iss-ee;[8]
    Georgian: თბილისი Georgian pronunciation: [tʰbilisi]), in some languages
    still known by its pre-1936 name Tiflis[a] (/ˈtɪflɪs/ TIF-liss),[8] is the
    capital and the largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura
    River with a population of approximately 1.5 million people. Tbilisi was
    founded in the 5th century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia, and since then has
    served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between
    1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire, Tiflis was the seat of the
    Caucasus Viceroyalty, governing both the northern and the southern parts of
    the Caucasus. <br />

    Because of its location on the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its
    proximity to the lucrative Silk Road, throughout history Tbilisi was a point
    of contention among various global powers. The city's location to this day
    ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and trade
    projects. Tbilisi's history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix
    of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Stalinist and the Modern
    structures.

    Historically, Tbilisi has been home to people of multiple cultural, ethnic,
    and religious backgrounds, though it is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox
    Christian. Its notable tourist destinations include cathedrals Sameba and
    Sioni, Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli Avenue, medieval
    Narikala Fortress, the pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian
    National Museum. The climate in Tbilisi mostly ranges from 20 to 32 °C (68
    to 90 °F) in the summer and −1 to 7 °C (30 to 45 °F) in the winter.
