      In late antiquity and early Middle Ages the ancient western Georgian
      kingdom of Egrisi existed on the territory of Imereti. Its king declared
      Christianity as an official religion of Egrisi in 523 AD. In 975-1466
      Imereti was part of the united Georgian Kingdom. Since its disintegration
      in the 15th century, Imereti was an independent kingdom. <br />

      In the 17th-18th centuries, the kingdom of Imereti experienced frequent
      invasions by the Turks and paid patronage to the Ottoman Empire until
      1810, when it was invaded and annexed by the Russian Empire. The last King
      of Imereti was Solomon II (1789-1810). <br />

      From 1918 to 1921, Imereti was part of the independent Democratic Republic
      of Georgia. Within the USSR, the region was part of the Transcaucasian
      SFSR from 1922–1936, and part of the Georgian SSR from 1936–1991. Since
      Georgian independence in 1991, Imereti has been a region of Georgia with
      Kutaisi as the regional capital.
