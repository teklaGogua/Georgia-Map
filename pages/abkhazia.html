  <h2>Abkhazia</h2>
  <p>
    The Abkhazians call their homeland Аԥсны (Apsny, Aṗsny), popularly
    etymologised as "a land/country of the soul", yet literally meaning "a
    country of mortals (mortal beings)". It possibly first appeared in the
    seventh century in an Armenian text as Psin(oun), perhaps referring to the
    ancient Apsilians.

    Abkhazia is part of Georgia's territory and has listed the province, in its
    official subdivisions, as an autonomous republic On 28 August 2008, the
    Parliament of Georgia passed a resolution declaring Abkhazia a
    "Russian-occupied territory". The Republic of Abkhazia, with Sukhumi as its
    capital, is a client state of Russia. It is formally recognised by Russia
    and by Nicaragua, and the de facto independent republics of South Ossetia
    and Transnistria. The European Union, OSCE, and NATO recognise Abkhazia as
    an integral part of the territory of Georgia.<br />
    The secessionist movement of the Abkhaz minority led to the Georgian–Abkhaz
    conflict. The War in Abkhazia resulted in a Georgian military defeat and the
    mass exodus and ethnic cleansing of the Georgian population from Abkhazia.
    There was a 1994 ceasefire agreement. There is a UN-monitored and
    Russian-dominated CIS peacekeeping operation. The sovereignty dispute has
    not been resolved. The dispute is a source of conflict between Georgia and
    Russia.

    Abkhazia is diverse geographically with lowlands stretching to the extremely
    mountainous north. The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range runs along the
    region's northern border, with its spurs – the Gagra, Bzyb and Kodori ranges
    – dividing the area into a number of deep, well-watered valleys.
